# RT Battle System

An horiziontal battle system inspired by old gen games.
It will have a nice custom combo system.

# TODO

A quick list of future features:
- **Attack cooldown** to prevent players to spam the X attack - *the attacker needs to wait for the animation anyway*.
- **Stamina system** Stamina will generate while resting and will be consumed for each attack
- **Combo System** Combo take previous inputs into consideration as well. The game will be more strategic thanks to the combinations of combos that fit together.

# Gameplay Guide

You can move with the directional arrows of the keyboard and attack with **X**.
